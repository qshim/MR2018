Raster Applet built with Processing for Magical RISO 2018 </br></br>
A project created for Magical RISO 2018 (Jan van Eyck Academie, The Netherlands), it is a simple tool that allows artists and designers to play with custom rasterization. It enables you to generate rasterization of an image of your choice using modules that you create and export from Illustrator. Code literates! You will be able to create diverse outcomes by adjusting the transformations of the modules written in code. The extent of continuity depends on the number and appearance of shapes. You can save the result in JPG and export it into PDFs with four channels. (You are welcome to expand the number of channels by adding a condition in the code.) </br>

The dimension of shape files in the /svgs folder is 100 x 100 pixels, but you can make your shape larger. (It might be fun to break standard guidelines to get unexpected outcomes!) The order of the modules is determined by their names in alphabetical order. </br>

Explore and design your own image textures by increasing or decreasing the number of modules, or altering their shapes. The system currently only displays filled-shapes, so if you have a stroke, you would need to expand it.</br></br>
